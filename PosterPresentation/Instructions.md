Dear Poster Session Participant, 

We're reaching out to you with some details about preparing your poster. The poster for printing must be submitted before November 11. Please make sure that the background of your poster is white. The reason for that is that poster backgrounds in color require a lot of color ink, which is currently in short supply at the college. Of course, you can use colored images and color in the text, we are just asking to keep the poster background white. Thank you very much for your help with this matter.

Please use the attached templates for your poster:  Landscape 42x31 in and Portraite 31x42 in. We cannot print posters of the other size.

Please email pdf file of your Poster to Calvin Grace cgrace@citytech.cuny.edu
 CC to rkezerashvili@citytech.cuny.edu

or upload the via Website

Once again, please do not forget to submit your poster for printing before November 11, so that there is sufficient time to print all the posters.

Best regards, 
Roman Kezerashvili
