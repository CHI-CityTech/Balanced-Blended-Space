# Balanced-Blended-Space
Balanced Blended Space (BBS) is a universal framework for describing any communication across physical, virtual, and conceptual spaces. It does so by defining mediation pathways that blend real and digital experiences, with applications in the arts and other fields. This repository focuses on the principles, syntax, and standards that define the BBS model.

# Balanced Blended Space (BBS) Framework

Welcome to the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** framework repository. BBS is a conceptual model designed to facilitate universal communication by blending physical, virtual, and conceptual spaces. While applicable across various domains, the performing arts serve as a primary testing ground for the development and refinement of this framework.

## Overview

The BBS framework operates on the principle of **balanced integration** between physical and virtual spaces, allowing for seamless communication, interaction, and collaboration. The model is based on the following core ideas:

- **Mediation Pathways**: Channels through which interactions pass between physical, virtual, and conceptual spaces. These pathways govern how communication and actions are transformed and perceived across these environments.
- **Blended Space**: A space where the boundaries between physical and virtual worlds are intentionally blurred, creating a unified interaction environment.
- **AI as a Collaborator**: The BBS framework treats artificial intelligence as an equal collaborator in communication and creation processes, not just a tool.

## Key Components

This repository serves as the central hub for the BBS framework and includes:

- **Core Principles**: Documentation of the theoretical foundation of the BBS model, including the principles of balanced blending between physical, virtual, and conceptual spaces.
- **Universal Communication Standards**: Guidelines for applying BBS across various domains, ensuring seamless interaction between spaces and mediation pathways.
- **Mediation Pathway Syntax**: Research and development of a syntax to describe how communication and interaction flow through physical, virtual, and conceptual layers.

### Folders

- **`Core-Principles/`**: 
  - Contains theoretical documents that outline the foundational ideas of the BBS framework, including explanations of blended spaces and mediation pathways.
  
- **`Universal-Communication-Standards/`**:
