## Graph Theory in BBS

### Speculation
Graph theory seems a reasonable mathematical system to explore the connections within BBS.  For example, each source or destination can be considered a vertice (node), each mediation pathway an edge.  However, the fact that during most mediations some sort of transformation must be applied, there is activity within an edge that could be considered a vertice itself.  

Another consideration involves undirected multigraphs:  perhaps this is how to represent intelligence:  information feeding upon itself.
